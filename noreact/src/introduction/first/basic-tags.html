    <h1>Basic HTML Tags</h1>
    <p>Those are some of the most common HTML tags.</p>
    <h2>Inline vs. Block Level Elements</h2>
    <h3>Block Level Elements</h3>
    <p>
      Block level elements are elements that take up an entire block on the page.
      A heading is a good example of this. It means any other elements will go
      underneath on their own line.
      On a simple page, 2 block elements will never go side-by-side (although this can be changed by css)
      All heading and paragraph in HTML are BLOCK LEVEL
    </p>

    <h5>The address tag</h5>
    <p>
      The address tags is used to mark up a real street address (not email or web)

      460 Portage
      Winterpeg, MB
      R2C 0E8
    </address>
    </p>

    <h5>The blockquote</h5>
    <p>
      The blockquote tags is used for longer quotes.

      incorrectly uses the tags as way indent text.

    <blockquote>
      what this. Oh this a blockquote.
      <p>this a p</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
    <p>
      Inline Tags are elements that do not take up the entire full width of the page.
      If they did, things would look rather strange.
      These tags sit INLINE with the surrounding text.
    </p>

    <h4>Logical Inline Tags</h4>
    <p>
      Some tags are logical. This means that they have meaning(semantics) associate with them.
      They are not just for visual presentation. They are not ascribe any kind of visual or presentational aspect of the
      contents.
      They are not concerned with appearance of anything. They are non-presentational.
      These are most often referred to as logical phrase character styles. Most of these elements are INLINE elements.
    </p>

    <h5>The Strong tag</h5>
    <p> This is <b>strong</b></p>

    <h5>The EM(emphasis) tag</h5>
    <p>
      The EM tag is used to create text that should be <em>emphasis</em> in some way.
      Most browser will display this as italics(slanted) text.
      However, this tag itself, just like strong tag does not describe the <em>appearance of the text</em> in any way.
