      <!-- Note: The name attribute is largely deprecated, but still allowed in forms,
           likely because PHP and other server scripts often still need it. XHTML will \
           NOT allow the name attribute on the <form> itself, but does allow it in an
           input. HTML5 allows the name attribute on both. -->

      <!-- The autocomplete attribute controls whether the form will a) retain the form
         field contents when refreshed or returned (with the back button) to, and b)
         add "saved" form data from the browser (ie: Chrome uses the blue highlighted
         fields when showing saved data). autocomplete can also be added to a single
         text-type input as well as the entire form. So you can have some parts of the form
         set to autocomplete (autocomplete="on" in the <form> tag), and set certain fields
         to NOT autocomplete (autocomplete="off" in a given <input> tag.)
         Note: The default value for autocomplete is "on" -->

      <!-- Note2: The "novalidate" attribute turns OFF the HTML5 default form validation. This is
          important to use if you are going to use JavaScript to validate the form instead -->

      <!-- Note3: The "tabindex" attribute can be used with numbers to control how the user
           "tabs" (presses the "tab" key) through the form fields. Avoid using this unless you
           really need to, as it can destroy usability on the form. People use tabs frequently
           on forms when filling out. -->

      <!-- Forms can be organized and split into different "sections" using something called
           "fieldsets". The fieldset tag has a child "legend" tag that allows you to properly
           label the different sections. These are visual (and logical) only, so they do not
           get sent in any way with the form data. They are purely to help the user filling the
           form.

             readonly does not change the appearance of the form field, but the
             user cannot change the contents. "disabled" will "grey out" or change
             the appearance of the form control. The user also cannot change the
             contents. These are more useful when you get to "dynamic" forms with
             JavaScript where values are being inserted dynamically. Note that if
             your field is set to "disabled", that field won't be sent to the
             script, even if you have the value set with the "value" attribute. -->

             Most browsers are not validating this field at present, but it is still
             a good idea to use it, since it provides mobile users with a "phone
             keypad" that makes it MUCH easier to type in a phone number -->

             type in non-numeric characters (they are supposed only accept numbers).
             Some of these browsers will then SEND the form field, but send it as
             empty. This can cause problems with some "validation" scripts that
             check form contents. -->

             format for something like a database. HOWEVER, the users location can
             result in a different date format. Example: In Canada, the date will
             show as yyyy-mm-dd, but on a US browser, it will be mm-dd-yyyy. -->

        <!-- Radio buttons are very specific in how they need to be written. Radio
           buttons are supposed to only allow a SINGLE choice of the options. To
           enable this behaviour, you need to set all the related buttons to the
           same NAME attribute. ID of course must still be unique, so leave them
           different. Also, radio buttons will look badly aligned if you put them
           AFTER their labels. Put the buttons first, labels right after, and
           separate with a <br /> tag. This is for good proximity. We don't want
           too much space between each radio choice. That is of course, up to the
           designer. Remember, later on with CSS, we can add more line spacing (leading)
           between each line of button/label for better "touch friendly" design.

           Note: Make sure to set a "value" for each button, otherwise "on" will be
           sent to the script. If no radio button is selected, that field will not
           show up at all in the form results.

            Checkboxs are for NON-EXCLUSIVE choices. Good for when more than one
            option can be selected.

            Note: If you make all the checkboxes with the same NAME attribute,
            only ONE will be submitted with the form. Make all the name attributes
            (just like the ID's) different. This can make the form results look
            a little strange, but it will work. Remember to use a different name
            for each. The form will only submit one item of a group of the same
            names (just like radio buttons).

             this will create a "box" instead of a pull-down menu. If the size is less
             than the total number of options, then scrollbars will appear. If the size

             recommended to use "multiple" as many users to not know how to use the
